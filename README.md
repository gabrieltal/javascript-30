Here is my attempt to run through the javascript 30. Might update this as I run through each to give a little feedback about what I learned through each exercise.

Day 1

01 - JavaScript Drum Kit
Done on Sunday March 25 2018
Fun exercise. Learned about the event listener 'transitionend'.
I also inspected the CSS and learned through the video about adding
transition timers through CSS with 'transition: all .07s ease'
