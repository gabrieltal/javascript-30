Here is my attempt to run through the javascript 30. Might update this as I run through each to give a little feedback about what I learned through each exercise.

01 - JavaScript Drum Kit
Done on Sunday March 25 2018
Fun exercise. Learned about the event listener 'transitionend'.
I also inspected the CSS and learned through the video about adding
transition timers through CSS with 'transition: all .07s ease'

02 - CSS Clock
Done on Monday March 26 2018
Little tough here. Tried it on my own without watching the video. I got it working however the code was suboptimal and I could tell.
I decided to watch and see what they did and compared it to mine.
I had the right idea. Their way of implementing was better so once I saw how they did the seconds I stopped the video and finished the rest. I commented out my previous attempt and left it there for posterity. I learned about some more CSS transform properties in the process. All around a good exercise!

03 - CSS Variables
Done on Tuesday March 27 2018
Another really cool exercise. I learned about CSS variables, how to change and update them, how to set them. I learned about two more event listeners, 'change' and 'mousemove'. I learned how to grab whole 'data' properites using 'dataset'.
